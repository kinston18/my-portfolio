# my-portfolio

This is my 3D-portfolio, which I've built using the following technologies:

 ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
 
 React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
 
 TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
 
 Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations
 
 
 
 
 Some other learnings which I made while making my portfolio were:
 
 Loading, creating and customizing stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
 
 Making my code resuable and scalable using High Order Components (HOCs) and some other industry-standard best practices
 
 Ensuring responsiveness across all devices and improvisation of site's perrformance using Suspense and Preload
 
 Finally also implemented email sending through a form on the website.
